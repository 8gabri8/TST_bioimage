Removed Data:
A3-1: Still exploitable samples but out of focus corners
B1 - All yellow channels badly acquired
B5 - All yellow channels badly acquired
B8 - Different kind of cell with badly acquired yellow channel
B10 - All yellow channels badly acquired
C2 - Different kind of cell
C3 - empty, no cells to segment
D1 - empty
D5 - Nothing in samples
D11 - Nothing in samples
F1 - Empty
G1 - Empty
G12 - Empty





Different kind of cells:
B8 - Different kind of cell with badly acquired yellow channel
B6 - Different kind of cell? do we still analyze
D3 - Different kind of cell?
D9 -Different cells
D10- Different cells
C10 - Different cells
C11 - Different cells
E7- Different cells
E10- different cells
F2-F3- Good sample of different kind of cells?
F4 - different cell type (GOOD EXAMPLE OF DEPLETED?)
F7 - different cell type
H3 - different cell type
H10 - different cell type (STRANGE)







Potential removal:
B4 - noisy background on yfp
// C1 -(4, 7) Yellow channel is off (we can work with them)
C5 - noise hard to remove
C6 - noise hard to remove
C9 - noisy
D4 - noisy
E2- few cells in sample
E5 - few cells in sample
E4 - 2 types of cells?
E8- 2 types of cells?
F8 - blurry?
F11 - noise hard to remove- turn image type to 32 bit, (process->filter->gaussian) then (median process filter of 2) dog with signma 0.5 to substract background and then median filter for the dispeckle
G2 - noise hard to remove
H2 - noisy
